                Results of the Testing of Program 4 -- Hashing

     Using the following information in my program I compiled this list of

 results for hashing by division with the collision resolutions of double

 hashing and quadratic resolution both with a fall back on linear probing.

                   Hashing Function:
                       K mod Table Size

                   Double Hashing Function:
                       max (1, K div Table Size)

                   Number of keys placed into the table: 90

         Table      Load                   Collisions:
         Size      Factor      Double Hashing     Quadratic Resolution
         -----     ------      --------------     --------------------
          217       .415            20                    30
          203       .443            25                    17
          199       .452            14                    15
          173       .520            48                    61
          157       .573           109                    70
          127       .709            38                    52
          101       .891           128                   117

       Based on these results, I selected double hashing for my program.

Double hashing was not head and shoulders above quadratic resolution though.

The number of collisions were close for some table numbers, with double

hashing performing better than quadratic resolution for some and quadratic

resolution performing better then double hashing for others, so from this

point, there is no winner.  I selected double hashing over quadratic

resolution in this case because there are less math operations performed

in my double hashing algorithm than my quadratic resolution algorithm.

Not not only there were more math operations for quadratic resolution, but

the math was more complex also.  I then examined the number of collisions

for double hashing on my various table sizes and selected the table size

of 199, which worked best for my data set of 90 keys.
