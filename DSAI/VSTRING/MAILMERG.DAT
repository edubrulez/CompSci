This is a long substitution field (#5). An interesting thought occurs here... what if a substitution field contains a substitution field... will it be substituted... we will try it here: sub field number 1 here: <1>. Did it work?  If so, what might happen if we tried to substitute field 5 in field 5? I will not try it!
P.S. Field 6 is for Postscripts
P.P.S Field seven is for post-postscripts
